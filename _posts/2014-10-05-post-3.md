Jekyll is very a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. you can use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (or [Textile](http://redcloth.org/textile)) and [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) converters and make a ready-to-publish static website.
if you have a Github account, you can host your blog on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free using Jekyll CMS. Jekyll generates static HTML files and serve it to users. Thus, the websites created by Jekyll are very fast & user friendly.
